# 19 - 42 Cursus



In this repo, you'll find all the projects I did from the 42 cursus while being in 19 school (Belgium)



<!-- If you want more information about any project, feel free to go take a look at the README file in each folder. The folders also contain the instructions (in English and French) in the pdf files -->

### Libft - *Your very first own library*

In this project, we had to create our own C library containing 44 functions that we will use later on in other projects.

<!-- ### Printf - *Because putnbr and putstr aren't enough*

Here, we had to recode the printf function which taught us how to use *variadic arguments*. -->
