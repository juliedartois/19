# Libft ( completed - 114% )

In this project, we create our own library of function to use in C. Later on, during other projects, we're allowed to use this library and the functions in it to simplify our code and also to prevent us from coding the same functions over and over again.

The required functions are separated in 3 main parts.

1. **Lib C functions**

	memset, bzero, memcpy, memccpy, memmove, memchr, memcmp, strlen, strlcpy, strlcat, strchr, strrchr, strnstr, strncmp, atoi, isalpha, isdigit, isalnum, isascii, isprint, toupper, tolower
	
	**using malloc :**
	calloc, strdup

2. **Additional functions**

	substr, strjoin, strtrim, split, itoa, strmapi, putchar_fd, putstr_fd, putendl_fd, putnbr_fd

3. **Bonus functions**

	lstnew, lstadd_front, lstsize, lstlast, lstadd_back, lstdelone, lstclear, lstiter, lstmap
